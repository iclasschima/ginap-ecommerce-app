# Hypothetical E-Commerce App - Frontend Implementation

This repository contains the frontend implementation of a hypothetical E-commerce app, showcasing key features such as user authentication, product listing, and checkout process.

## Features Implemented

### Authentication

- User Registration: Create new accounts with full name, username, and password.
- User Login: Sign in using usernames and passwords.
- Sign-out: Log out securely from accounts.

### Products Listing

- Product Catalog: Browse and explore a variety of products for purchase.
- Product Details: View detailed information, including images, descriptions, and prices.

### Checkout Process

- Cart Management: Add products to cart while browsing.
- Cart Review: Review items in the cart before payment.
- Checkout: Complete purchase.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: Frontend built with the React library.
- **State Management**: Utilize React's `useState` hook for state management.
- **UI/UX Framework**: NativeBase UI library for consistent and appealing UI.
- **Form Management**: Formik for handling form inputs, validation, and submission.
- **Data Fetching**: React Query for data fetching and management.
- **Routing**: React Navigation for screen navigation.
- **User Feedback**: React Native Toast Message for user-friendly feedback.

## Data Source

The product data showcased in this app is obtained from [dummyjson.com](https://dummyjson.com/docs). Similarly, the login details used for demonstration purposes are also from the same source. The credentials provided for registration are not functional for login, as this app is a simulation and [dummyjson.com](https://dummyjson.com/docs) does not offer a registration endpoint.

## Login Credentials

You can use the following dummy login credentials to test the authentication feature:

- **Username:** atuny0
- **Password:** 9uQFF1Lh

(See "https://dummyjson.com/users" For more credentials)

## Tools Used

- React Native
- NativeBase UI library
- Formik for form management
- React Query for data fetching and state management
- React Native Toast Message for displaying feedback messages

## About the React Native for Both Mobile & Web

I can achieve both the responsive and functional on the web involves using tools like React Native Web to share code, adapting components for touch interactions, implementing responsive styling using media queries and layout techniques, and addressing platform-specific differences through conditionals.
